## Overview of the Project
### Project: Calculator Application

This project is a **Calculator Application** developed using Java Swing. It provides basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, along with functionalities for negation, decimal input, clearing inputs, and deleting characters. The application features a graphical user interface (GUI) designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind. Users can input numbers and perform calculations seamlessly through the buttons provided.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a functional Calculator Application using Java Swing. The aim is to provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface for performing basic arithmetic operations, as well as additional functionalities like negation, deletion, and clearing inputs. Through this project, we aim to explore GUI design principles, event handling, and the integration of responsive components in Java. The focus is on creating a robust, interactive, and efficient calculator for day-to-day mathematical operations.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Negation Function**: Allows users to toggle between positive and negative values.
- **Decimal Input**: Supports decimal numbers for precise calculations.
- **Delete Function**: Enables users to delete the last entered character.
- **Clear Function**: Resets the input field for new calculations.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Designed using Java Swing for a simple and interactive user experience.
